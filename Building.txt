Notes for Building Insight.Database.Schema
==========================================

* Build requires Psake. You can get it from http://nuget.org/packages/Psake
* You will need to provide your own Insight.Database.Schema.Tests.dll.config file with your test connection strings. Try this one:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<configuration>
  <connectionStrings>
    <add name="TestSql" connectionString="Data Source = .; Initial Catalog = InsightTestCases; Trusted_Connection = true"/>
  </connectionStrings>
</configuration>
